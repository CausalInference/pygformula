Visit process
=================

When the data are not recorded at regular intervals but rather are recorded everytime the patient visits the
clinic, the times at which the time-varying covariates are measured will vary by subject. In this setting,
it is typical to construct the data such that (i) at a time when there is no visit/measurement,
the last measured value of a covariate is carried forward, and (ii) a subject is censored after a certain number of consecutive times
with no visit/measurement [1]_ :sup:`,` [2]_.

In pygformula, the deterministic knowledge (i) and (ii) can be incorporated via the argument ‘‘visitprocess’’.
Each vector in ‘‘visitprocess’’ contains three parameters that attach a visit process to one covariate.
The first parameter is the name of a time-varying indicator in the input data set of whether a covariate was measured in each interval
(1 means there is a visit/measurement, 0 means there is no visit/measurement).
The second parameter is the name of the covariate. The third parameter is the maximum number s of missed measurements of this covariate allowed
since the last measurement before a subject is censored.

For the visit indicator, in the fitting step, the probability of a visit is estimated only using records
where the sum of consecutive missed visits through previous k-1 time points is less than the maximum number of consecutive missed visits s.
Then in the simulation step, if the sum of consecutive missed visits through previous k-1 time points is less than s, then the visit
indicator is simulated from a distribution based on this estimate; otherwise, the visit indicator is set to 1 so
as to eliminate subjects with more than s consecutive missed visits. For the covariate, in the fitting step, the conditional mean of the covariate will be estimated
only for data records where there is a current visit. If the visit indicator equals 1, then in simulation step, the value of the
dependent covariate will be generated from a distribution based on this estimate; otherwise, the last value is
carried forward.



The argument for visit process:

    * - Arguments
      - Description
    * - visitprocess
      - (Optional) List of lists. Each inner list contains its first entry the covariate name of a visit process; its second entry
        the name of a covariate whose modeling depends on the visit process; and its third entry the maximum number
        of consecutive visits that can be missed before an individual is censored.

.. code::

        covnames = ['visit_cd4', 'visit_rna', 'cd4_v', 'rna_v', 'everhaart']
        covtypes = ['binary', 'binary', 'normal', 'normal', 'binary']
        covmodels = ['visit_cd4 ~ lag1_everhaart + lag_cumavg1_cd4_v + sex + race + month',
                     'visit_rna ~ lag1_everhaart + lag_cumavg1_rna_v + sex + race + month',
                     'cd4_v ~ lag1_everhaart + lag_cumavg1_cd4_v + sex + race + month',
                     'rna_v ~ lag1_everhaart + lag_cumavg1_rna_v + sex + race + month',
                     'everhaart ~ lag1_everhaart + cd4_v + rna_v + sex + race + month']

        visitprocess = [['visit_cd4', 'cd4_v', 3], ['visit_rna', 'rna_v', 3]]

        g = ParametricGformula(..., covnames = covnames, covtypes = covtypes, covmodels = covmodels, visitprocess = visitprocess, ...)


Here is an example in clinical cohorts of HIV-positive patients, ‘‘cd4_v’’ is a time-varying covariate of CD4 cell count measurement,
the visit indicator ‘‘visit_cd4’’ indicats whether the CD4 cell count measurements were taken in interval k.
3 means that the data is constructed such that the subjects are censored once they have not had CD4 measured for 3 consecutive intervals.
Note that for the visit indicator ‘‘visit_cd4’’, it should come before the dependent covariate ‘‘cd4_v’’ and be assigned
the ‘‘binary’’ covariate type in ‘‘covtypes’’.
