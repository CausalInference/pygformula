     .. code::

        hazard_ratio = g.summary_dict['hazard_ratio']

The package also implement nonparametric bootstrapping to obtain 95% confidence intervals for risk/mean estimates
by repeating the algorithm for many bootstrap samples. Users can choose the argument ‘‘nsamples’’ to specify the number of new generated bootstrap samples.
Users may choose the argument ‘‘parallel’’ to parallelize bootstrapping and simulation steps under each intervention to
make the algorithm run faster. The argument ‘‘ncores’’ can be used to specify the desired number of CPU cores
in parallarization.

The package provides two ways for calculating the confidence intervals
in argument ‘‘ci_method’’, ‘‘percentile’’ means using percentile bootstrap method which takes the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the bootstrap estimates to get the 95% confidence interval,
"normal" means using the normal bootstrap method which uses the the original estimate and
the standard deviation of the bootstrap estimates to get the normal approximation 95% confidence interval.

+ **The g-formula estimates of bootstrap samples**: The package gives the parametric g-formula estimates of all
  bootstrap samples, which can be obtained by:

     .. code-block::

        g = ParametricGformula(..., nsamples = 20, parallel=True, n_core=10, ci_method = 'percentile', ...)
        g.fit()
        bootests = g.summary_dict['bootests']

  To get the parametric g-formula estimates of a particular bootstrap sample, please use:

     .. code::

        g.summary_dict['bootests']['sample_{id}_estimates']

  where id is the sample id which should be an integer between 0 and ‘‘nsamples’’ - 1.


+ **The coefficients of bootstrap samples**: The package gives the parameter estimates of all the models for all generated
  bootstrap samples, which can be obtained by:

     .. code-block::

        g = ParametricGformula(..., nsamples = 20, parallel=True, n_core=10, ci_method = 'percentile', boot_diag=True, ...)
        g.fit()
        bootcoeffs = g.summary_dict['bootcoeffs']

Note that the ‘‘boot_diag’’ should be set to true if users want to obtain the coefficients, standard errors or variance-covariance matrices
of bootstrap samples.

  To get the coefficients of a particular bootstrap sample, please use:

     .. code::

        g.summary_dict['bootcoeffs']['sample_{id}_coeffs']

+ **The standard errors of bootstrap samples**: The package gives the standard errors of the parameter estimates of all the models for all generated
  bootstrap samples, which can be obtained by:

     .. code-block::

        g = ParametricGformula(..., nsamples = 20, parallel=True, n_core=10, ci_method = 'percentile', boot_diag=True, ...)
        g.fit()
        bootstderrs = g.summary_dict['bootstderrs']

  To get the standard errors of a particular bootstrap sample, please use:

     .. code::

        g.summary_dict['bootstderrs']['sample_{id}_stderrs']


+ **The variance-covariance matrices of bootstrap samples**: The package gives the variance-covariance matrices of the parameter estimates of all the models for all generated
  bootstrap samples, which can be obtained by:

     .. code-block::

        g = ParametricGformula(..., nsamples = 20, parallel=True, n_core=10, ci_method = 'percentile', boot_diag=True, ...)
        g.fit()
        bootvcovs = g.summary_dict['bootvcovs']

  To get the variance-covariance matrices of a particular bootstrap sample, please use:

     .. code::

        g.summary_dict['bootvcovs']['sample_{id}_vcovs']


Note that to get bootstrap results of coefficients, standard errors, and variance-covariance matrices, the argument
‘‘boot_diag’’ must be set to True.

All the output results above can be saved by the argument ‘‘save_results’’, once it is set to True,
results will be saved locally by creating a folder automatically. Users can also specify the folder path by the
argument ‘‘save_path’’:

     .. code-block::

        g = ParametricGformula(..., save_results = True, save_path = 'user-specified path', ...)
        g.fit()

The package also provides two plotting functions: "plot_natural_course" and "plot_interventions".

non-parametric estimation.

The plot_interventions function plots the curves of risk under interventions of interest (for survival outcomes only).

Users can call the 'plot_natural_course' function by:

     .. code-block::

        g.plot_natural_course()

Users can call the 'plot_interventions' function by:

     .. code-block::

        g.plot_interventions()


Note that the plotting functions can only be applied after calling the 'g.fit' function.

The figures can be saved by the argument ‘‘save_figure’’, once it is set to True,
results will be saved locally by creating a folder automatically. If the argument ‘‘save_path’’ is specified, the figure will be saved to the corresponding folder.


**Sample syntax**:

.. code-block::

        g.plot_natural_course(plot_name='L1', colors=['blue', 'red'], markersize=5, linewidth=1, marker='v', save_figure=True)
        g.plot_interventions(colors =['green', 'red', 'yellow'], markersize=5, linewidth=1, marker='v', save_figure=True)

.. note::

   We recommend setting the ‘‘save_figure’’ as True if users want to access the figure
   when running the package on Linux system.
