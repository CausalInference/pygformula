        value and the second element specifies the truncated direction (‘left’ or ‘right’). The non-NA value is set
        for the truncated normal covariates. The 'NA' value is set for other covariates. The list should be the same
        length as covnames and in the same order.

    baselags: Bool
        A boolean value specifying the convention used for lagi and lag_cumavgi terms in the model statements when
        pre-baseline times are not included in obs_data and when the current time index, t, is such that t < i. If this
        argument is set to False, the value of all lagi and lag_cumavgi terms in this context are set to 0 (for
        non-categorical covariates) or the reference level (for categorical covariates). If this argument is set to
        True, the value of lagi and lag_cumavgi terms are set to their values at time 0. The default is False.

        in the second entry are not True.

        List of lists. For each inner list, its first entry is a dictionary whose key is the conditions which

        simulation when the conditions in the first entry are not True.

    compevent_restrictions: List
        List of lists. For each inner list, its first entry is a dictionary whose key is the conditions which
        should be True when the competing event is modeled, the second entry is the value that is set to the competing
        event during simulation when the conditions in the first entry are not True. Only applicable for survival outcomes.
